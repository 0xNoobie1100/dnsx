# Installation Instructions

### From Source

The installation is easy. You can download the pre-built binaries for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx/releases/) page. Extract them using tar, move it to your `$PATH`and you're ready to go.

```sh
Download latest binary from https://github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx/releases

â–¶ tar -xvf dnsx-linux-amd64.tar
â–¶ mv dnsx-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/dnsx
â–¶ dnsx -h
```

### From Source

**dnsx** requires **go1.14+** to install successfully. Run the following command to get the repo - 

```sh
â–¶ GO111MODULE=on go get -u -v github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx/cmd/dnsx
```

### From Github

```sh
â–¶ git clone https://github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx.git; cd dnsx/cmd/dnsx; go build; mv dnsx /usr/local/bin/; dnsx -version
```

### Running dnsx

To query a list of domains, you can pass the list via stdin (it also accepts full URLS, in this case the domain is extracted automatically).

```sh
â–¶ subfinder -silent -d hackerone.com | dnsx -resp

# ðŸ“‹ Notes

- Domain name input is mandatory for wildcard elimination.
- No other flag works when using wildcard filtering.

# Note on wildcards

A special feature of dnsX is its ability to handle multi-level DNS based wildcards and do it so with very less number of DNS requests. Sometimes all the subdomains will resolve which will lead to lots of garbage in the results. The way dnsX handles this is it will keep track of how many subdomains point to an IP and if the count of the Subdomains increase beyond a certain small threshold, it will check for wildcard on all the levels of the hosts for that IP iteratively.

dnsx is made with ðŸ–¤ by the [projectdiscovery](https://projectdiscovery.io) team.
